OMG, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Dual, and seriously, my brain is like... kinda fried right now, haha. You know when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a  , and you're trying to process everything that happened, but like, pieces are just floating around? That's me right now.

Simon will laugh if I tell him I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   instead of 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨, but hey, it worked, and whatever. The dual thing? Mind-blowing. I kept thinking, what would I do with a clone? Like, do we become besties, or do I try to sabotage clone-me? Seriously, think about it. Do you think your clone would be cooler than you or just a major pain? Random thought, but having a clone while binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 stuff would be lit. One orders pizza, the other picks the  . Ideal life.

> And seriously, the main character, right? She’s so... ugh! Relatable but also like, What are you doing?! I got way too into that fight scene and even spilled my drink. So worth it tho. This whole concept, fighting yourself, is wild and makes me wonder who’d even, like, win in my case. What if I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   again, just to compare notes with myself? Haha, one me takes notes, the other me just enjoys the show. 

But why, oh why, did they choose that ending? Talk about a mind twist! I didn't see that coming at all, and now I'm left chewing on it at 2 AM with no one to discuss it with. Thanks a lot, brain. You know when your mind's just buzzing, and you're like, should I sleep or should I just re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Choices, choices!

Random code outta nowhere: int cloneCounter = 0;

Anyway, now I’m sitting here wondering if I should call it a night and dive into dreamland or scroll through memes till I pass out, haha. Any recommendations from your side to cleanse my brain after this rollercoaster?
